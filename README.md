customMatrixOperations
======================
#Objective

This project is aimed to dive into the computer algorithms used to perform linear algebra functions with matrices. This program is written in MATLAB using Object-Oriented Principles.

####Implementations of custom linear algebra functions (from scratch) include:

* matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication
* transposition
* row reduction
* determinant calculation
* inversion
* eigenvector/eigenvalue calculation
* solving linear systems of equations (using both direct and iterative methods)
* EDIT THESE!
